# WINDOWS 10 ARM64 for Raspberry Pi 4 2/4GB (FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY! NO OFFICIAL RELEASE FROM MICROSOFT)

This is a backup image of a working Windows 10 ARM64 in a Raspberry Pi 4. It is for a 32GB mSD card (mininum) and I recomend at least an SanDisk Extreme UHS-I V30 microSDHC 32GB to be used with this OS. TESTING PURPOSES ONLY!

#
## Installation

Just download the image and restore the backup to an mSD card with HDD Raw Copy (https://hddguru.com/software/HDD-Raw-Copy-Tool/).

After that plug your mSD card in to the Pi4 and turn it on.

#
## How it was created

This image was created using the Windows on Raspberry tool (https://www.worproject.ml/) and the WoA-Installer-RPi (https://github.com/WOA-Project/WoA-Installer-Rpi/blob/master/Docs/GettingWoA.md) and has been a optimized a bit (some services disabled, Windows Update disabled, Windows Defender disabled (The firewall is still running).

After using it for a while I can say to you guys that it's very stable and the x86 emulator works very well! In the image bellow you can see a Windows Forms app created in Visual Studio working!

In the 4GB Pi4 version it only uses 3GB of RAM, but even so, it's very nice to have a desktop Windows on a Pi4. The network interface is working but the sound, wifi and bluetooth aren't.

## Notes

I hope you enjoy the image and I repeat again, this is for TESTING PURPOSES ONLY, Microsoft does not have and official Windows 10 Arm64 for the Raspberry Pi yet and you will not be able to buy a cd-key to activate this Windows!

Please make sure to share your suggestions!
