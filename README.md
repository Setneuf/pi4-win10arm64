# WINDOWS 10 ARM64 for Raspberry Pi 4 2/4GB (FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY! NO OFFICIAL RELEASE FROM MICROSOFT)

This is a backup image of a working Windows 10 ARM64 is a Raspberry Pi 4. It is for a 32GB mSD card (mininum) and I recomend at least an SanDisk Extreme UHS-I V30 microSDHC 32GB for this TESTING PURPOSE ONLY!

#
## Installation

Just download the image and restore the backup to an mSD card with HDD Raw Copy (https://hddguru.com/software/HDD-Raw-Copy-Tool/).

After that plug your mSD card in to the Pi4 and turn it on.

#
## How it was created

This image was created using the Windows on Raspberry tool (https://www.worproject.ml/) and the WoA-Installer-RPi (https://github.com/WOA-Project/WoA-Installer-Rpi/blob/master/Docs/GettingWoA.md) and has been a optimized a bit (some services disabled, Windows Update disabled, Windows Defender disabled (The firewall is still running).

After using it for a while I can say to you guys that it's very stable and the x86 emulator works very well!

In the 4GB Pi4 version it only uses 3GB of RAM, but even so, it's very nice to have a desktop Windows on a Pi4.

## Notes

I hope you enjoy the image and I repeat again, this is for TESTING PURPOSES ONLY, Microsoft does not have and oficcial Windows Arm64 for the Raspberry Pi yet and you will not be able to buy a cd-key to activate this Windows!

Please make sure to share your suggestions!
